# Hawaii-Weather-Analysis

This repository contains the code for a [Flask application](https://github.com/wawilson810/Hawaii-Weather-Analysis/blob/main/app.py) that will reflect a [SQL database](https://github.com/wawilson810/Hawaii-Weather-Analysis/blob/main/hawaii.sqlite) of weather observations from Hawaii, analyze the data and display it. Specifically the application displays the precipitation levels by date, the stations the weather data was collected from, temperature data from the most active station and the average, minimum and maximum temperatures for a date range specified in the URL. This repository also contains a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/wawilson810/Hawaii-Weather-Analysis/blob/main/climate_starter.ipynb) that was used to prototype the code, ensuring the majority of the functionality of the analysis was in place before being adapted for the Flask application.
