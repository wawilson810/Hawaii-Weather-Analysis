# Hawaii-Weather-Analysis

This repository contains a jupyter notebook and python script that both utilize sqlalchemy to reflect a database of weather observations from Hawaii and analyze it. The Jupyter notebook creates a pair of plots to visualize the data. The python script creates a web application using flask that displays the precipitation levels by date, the stations the weather data was collected from, temperature data from the most active station; and the average, minimum and maximum temperatures for a date range specified in the URL.
